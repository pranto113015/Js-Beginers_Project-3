# Storing user preference using JavaScript

## 1. Description

Storing user preferences using JavaScript involves saving settings like font size, bgcolor or layout choices on the client side. This can be done using `localStorage` for persistent storage across sessions, `sessionStorage `for temporary storage during a single session, or cookies for data that can be shared with the server and have an expiration date. These methods allow you to enhance user experience by remembering their preferences.
